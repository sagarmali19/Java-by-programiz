public class Polymorphism {
    // it means having different forms

    // runtime polymorphism
    /*During inheritance in Java, if the same method is present in both the superclass and the subclass.
    Then, the method in the subclass overrides the same method in the superclass. This is called method overriding.*/

    // method overloading
    // same name but different return type or/and different parameters

    // operator overloading
    // + -> used for string concatination and addition of integers

   /* Object variables (instance variables) represent the behavior of polymorphic variables in Java.
    It is because object variables of a class can refer to objects of its class as well as objects of its subclasses.*/

    // Encapsulation : fields and methods are toigether inside the class -> it is not data hiding
    // data hiding is done using access modifiers
}
